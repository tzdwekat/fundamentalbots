# fundabot

Sourced, deterministic fundamental analysis of US-listed stocks with persona agents.
See `docs/architecture.md` and `docs/superpowers/specs/` for the design.

## Setup

```
docker compose up -d        # Postgres 16 + pgvector on localhost:5433
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$HOME/.venvs/fundabot   # see note below
uv sync
cp .env.example .env        # fill in keys
uv run fundabot init-db
```

**Why the venv lives outside the repo:** on this machine macOS marks every file under `./.venv` as
hidden within seconds, and Python 3.12 skips hidden `.pth` files, which silently breaks the editable
install (`ModuleNotFoundError: fundabot`). Keeping the environment under `~/.venvs` avoids it. Put the
`export` in your shell profile.
